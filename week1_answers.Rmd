# Questions and Answers

## Question

Q1. What does $V_{2}$ mean in the context of this equation:
$$
\frac{V_{1}}{n_{1}}\ = \frac{V_{2}}{n_{2}}\ 
$$

## Answer:

The $V_{2}$ shows the new volume of a gas (in constant pressure and temperature) based on the initial volume and moles of the gas and the final moles of the gas. 

## Question:

Q2. If you have a 22 liters of oxygen gas that contain 3 mol of oxygen, how many mol of gas would 30 liters of oxygen have?

## Answer

```{r}
calc_mol_list <- list(v1=8.314, n1=80, v2=20)
n2 <- (calc_mol_list$v2*calc_mol_list$n1)/calc_mol_list$v1
print (n2)
```

## Question

Q3. What happens (to the mol value) if the volume of a gas increases and the temperature and pressure remain constant?

## Answer

The mol increases.

## Question

Q4. What are the two variables that should remain constant to comply with Avogadro's Law?

## Answer

The temperature and the pressure.
